Neutrino
========

A high performance library for storing scalar timeseries data in redis.

Installation
============

To install, simply type:

    $ sudo pip install neutrino

Design
======

Time series are stored as scalar values in bins with a fixed time step.
These bins are stored in chunks, and each chunk is stored under a single
redis key.

Instead of specifying these parameters for each time series individually,
the parameters are specified for a *pattern*, which is a regular
expression.  When time series data is later added, the name of each time
series is matched to these patterns, and for each match a time series is
added.

For example, the rule

    >>> ts.add_rule(r'spam.*','f',1,10,100,'avg')

will match any key starting with 'spam'. Any key matching this pattern
will be stored in a time series which will average multiple values in a
single bin, with a time step of 1 second, a chunk size of 10, and chunks
will expire after 100 seconds.
